Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

Small Pizza: $15
Medium Pizza: $20
Large Pizza: $25
Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1
Example Input
size = "L"
add_pepperoni = "Y"
extra_cheese = "N"
Example Output
Your final bill is: $28.'''


2_Instructions
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers
to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

"Your score is **z**."

e.g.

name1 = "Angela Yu"

name2 = "Jack Bauer"

T occurs 0 times

R occurs 1 time

U occurs 2 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 5

L occurs 1 time

O occurs 0 times

V occurs 0 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 3

Love Score = 53

Print: "Your score is 53."


#1- Escriba un programa en el que Ud. entra un entero y se determina si es par o impar


#2- Escriba un programa que determine la cantidad que Ud.debe pagar para
#   entrar en un parque. Si tiene   una estatura > 150 cm puede entrar de lo contrario
#   no puede entrar. Si tiene una edad > 21 años paga 12, de lo contrario paga 7.




#3- Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
#   Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name
#   that you input.




#4'''Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days,
leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really
fascinating, this video does it more justice:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the
commas and full stops.

Example Input 1
2400
Example Output 1
Leap year.'''
